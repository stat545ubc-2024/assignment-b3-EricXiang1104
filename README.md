# **Assignment B3 Shiny App Development**

This assignment is creating a web using shiny app. The goal of this app is to plot histogram for the mean variables in the cancer_sample dataset. It will also filter out the variable it is plotting and then rearrange the dataset based on the variable of interest. The app utilizes the cancer_data from the datateachr package

The data cancer_sample is from datateachr package, an open source data for education purpose.This cancer_data contains a sample of quantitative features that were calculated from images of nuclei present in fine needle aspiration biopsies of breast masses from patients at the University of Wisconsin Hospital. For this assignment, I am focusing on the mean data.
